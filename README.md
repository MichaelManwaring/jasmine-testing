# Feed Reader Testing Project

To run this application, download the repository and navigate to the index.html. The page will load a feed of articles that can be clicked on and read, or you can change the feed by clicking the hamburger-icon and using the hidden menu.

Jasmine test suite will run automatically and show 7 tests passing. If you would like to verify that these test perform as described, comment out lines in the js/app.js to break the functionality. The descriptive tests will inform you what has been broken and how.
